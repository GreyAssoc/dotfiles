Ensure that excavations are carefully trimmed and levelled using hand tools and left free from debris. Temporary supports in the form of reinforced shuttering ply shall be installed to the sides of the excavations to protect them from collapse if necessary. The excavations shall be mass filled as soon as possible following the inspection of the Building Control Officer.

That an independent engineer will be engaged to review the proposals insofar as they relate to the removal of any load bearing walls, and subsequent replacement with steel beams.
That the proposed underpinning works shall be carried out by compentent, and adequately insured, contractors.
That the temporary works design shall be approved by the design engineer prior to works commencing.
